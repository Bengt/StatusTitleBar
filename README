Status Title Bar

Gnome-Shell extension that shows the current focused window's title in the status panel when maximized.

It replaces the current AppButton that shows the current focused application's name. If the window is not maximized then it fallbacks to showing the focused applications name instead.


TODO:

1) Trim the window title so it fits nicely in the status panel.
