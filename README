Status Title Bar
Author: Edgar Merino <donvodka at gmail dot com>

Gnome-Shell extension that shows the current focused window's title in the status panel when maximized.

It replaces the current AppButton that shows the current focused application's name. If the window is not maximized then it fallbacks to showing the focused applications name instead.


Installation instructions:

cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
git clone git@github.com:emerinohdz/StatusTitleBar.git
mv StatusTitleBar StatusTitleBar@devpower.org 

TODO:

1) Trim the window title so it fits nicely in the status panel.
